# Accord base ransacked! Undead run amok!

The quiet afternoon at the Accord controlled Fort Hope was shattered when hundreds of undead sprang from the ground WITHIN THE FORT WALLS. Soldiers scrambled against the grasping tide. Bodies both recently alive and recently undead littered the dirt. 

First hand accounts tell a harrowing tale of near disaster as the fort looked close to defeat. However, in the middle of the losing battle a new element joined the fray. The infamous magician troupe known as "The Blackmist" barreled headlong into danger. Currently performing their daring act "Blades II: The Cleavering", the group, consisting of headliner Kenny Blackwater and the mighty strong Zigfrieda (both supported by the stagemaster Bob Dobalina), plunged headlong into the fray!

Witnesses at the scene saw Kenny and Zigfrieda wade into the zomboid menace with blades flashing in what was describe as "A DANCE OF DEATH". The soulless specters stood no chance against the razor sharp implements that shimmied through their desiccated flesh.

Suddenly, a terrible CRACK resonated across the plane. Seven zombies lost their heads, while all living heads turned to see the stagemaster beyond the smoking barrel of his artillery like EVENINGSTAR rifle.

Evidently the skills of this group was not all just an act! The tide seemed to turn! The soldiers rallied and hope blossomed!

That hope, like all hope on Venture, was short-lived. A terrible laugh echoed across the land and the smoky form of a REVENANT appeared just outside the fort. This foul beast struck fear into the hearts of all and seemed to be the director of the attack.

The soldiers saw it swing for Bob, who, aided by a quick warning from Zigfrieda, agilely dodged from its grasp, like the great cats that populate Thunderhead. A shot from his OATHBREAKER sidearm ripped a hole in the beast.

All attention turned as the abomination screamed at the blast. Kenny stood frozen while Zigfrieda continued her DANCE OF DEATH. Was the battle lost to this new threat? Time stood frozen as the soldiers waited to see what would happen next.

Captain Joe of the Accord saw the beast and rallied on his regal steed with soldiers in tow. That broke the brief silence as all efforts focused on the leader of the UNDEAD MENACE. Kenny and Zigfrieda ran to the aid of their compatriot, Zigfrieda with blades and Kenny with the EQUALIZER blunderbuss.

Now this horror's goose was cooked. The REVANANT was distracted by some unseen force and the Blackmist crew got to work. A shout from Bob saw Kenny's deafening shot with the EQUALIZER land true! Zigfrieda's blades peeled away the insubstantial substance! Bob threw one of his many contraptions, a rocket propelled bloa designed exclusively for HORRORS FROM BEYOND.

A final shot from the EQUALIZER sent the fiendish beast back to hell. Cheers rang out from the fort as many lives were saved! The Blackmist were celebrated all night at the fort and treated to the most luxurious accommodations Fort Hope could muster. It looks like this group's skills are not just an ACT!

What will happen next? What amazing adventures will be found across the wild world that is Venture? Keep your eyes out for the next issue, and keep a silver in pocket so you won't miss it!
